# CS-517-Semester-Project

This program will take CPU temperature reading data and, for each core, generate a piecewise linear interpolation and a global linear least-squares approximation.

The files currently contained herein are from https://github.com/cstkennedy/cs417-examples/tree/master/SemesterProject-CPU-Temps/cpp


# Usage

Currently, the project's core functionality is not implemented.

Eventually, it will take as an argument a .txt file containing whitespace-delimited temperature readings.
From these readings, the linear interpolation and least-squares approximations will be generated and output.
